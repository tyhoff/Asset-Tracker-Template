# Location module

This module manages location services using the [Location library](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/libraries/modem/location.html) in the nRF Connect SDK. It handles GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) initialization, location requests, and processes location events. The module uses Zephyr's state machine framework (SMF) and zbus for messaging with other modules.

The module performs the following tasks:

- Initializing and managing the location library and GNSS functionality.
- Handling location requests and processing location events.
- Managing different location methods (GNSS, cellular, Wi-Fi) and fallback scenarios.
- Updating system time using GNSS time data when available.
- Publishing location status updates to other modules.

The location module works in conjunction with the network module, as GNSS functionality can only be initialized after the modem is initialized and enabled.
It uses the Location library's event handler to process various location-related events and publish status updates through the zbus messaging system.

In the following sections, the module's main messages, configurations, and state machine are covered.
Refer to the source files (`location.c`, `location.h`, and `Kconfig.location`) for implementation details.

## Architecture

### State diagram

The Location module implements a state machine with the following states and transitions:

![Location module state diagram](../images/location_module_state_diagram.svg "Location module state diagram")

## Messages

The location module publishes and receives messages over the zbus channel `location_chan`. All module message types are defined in `location.h` and used within `location.c`.

### Input messages

- **LOCATION_SEARCH_TRIGGER:**
  Triggers a location search request. The module will attempt to get the current location using configured methods.

- **LOCATION_GNSS_SEARCH_TRIGGER:**
  Requests a GNSS-only fix, bypassing Wi-Fi and cellular methods.

- **LOCATION_SCAN_SEARCH_TRIGGER:**
  Requests a Wi-Fi and cellular scan with no GNSS, publishing the result as
  **LOCATION_CLOUD_REQUEST**. Handled only when **CONFIG_APP_LOCATION_SCAN_TRIGGER** is enabled.

    This exists because **LOCATION_SEARCH_TRIGGER** cannot be used to obtain cell and Wi-Fi
    observations: the Location library treats its method list as a fallback chain and stops at the
    first method that succeeds, so a GNSS fix ends the request before any scan is performed.
    Wi-Fi and cellular are placed next to each other in the method list, which makes the Location
    library combine them into a single cloud request carrying both.

- **LOCATION_SEARCH_CANCEL:**
  Cancels an ongoing location search. See `location.h` for known limitations with Wi-Fi scanning.

### Output messages

- **LOCATION_MODULE_READY:**
  Indicates that the location module has finished initialization.

- **LOCATION_SEARCH_STARTED:**
  Indicates that a location search has been initiated.

- **LOCATION_SEARCH_DONE:**
  Indicates that a location search has completed (successfully or with error/timeout).

- **LOCATION_GNSS_DATA:**
  Contains a successful GNSS fix.

- **LOCATION_CLOUD_REQUEST:**
  Contains cellular neighbor cell and/or Wi-Fi access point information that should be sent to cloud services for location resolution.

- **LOCATION_AGNSS_REQUEST:**
  Indicates that A-GNSS assistance data is needed for GNSS positioning.

The message types used by the location module are defined in `location.h`:

```c
enum location_msg_type {
    LOCATION_SEARCH_STARTED = 0x1,
    LOCATION_SEARCH_DONE,
    LOCATION_CLOUD_REQUEST,
    LOCATION_AGNSS_REQUEST,
    LOCATION_GNSS_DATA,
    LOCATION_MODULE_READY,
    LOCATION_SEARCH_TRIGGER,
    LOCATION_GNSS_SEARCH_TRIGGER,
    LOCATION_SEARCH_CANCEL,
    LOCATION_SCAN_SEARCH_TRIGGER,
};
```

## Configurations

Several Kconfig options in `Kconfig.location` control this module's behavior. The following configuration parameters are associated with this module:

- **CONFIG_APP_LOCATION:**
  Enables the location module. Automatically selected if **CONFIG_LOCATION** is enabled.

- **CONFIG_APP_LOCATION_THREAD_STACK_SIZE:**
  Stack size for the location module's main thread.

- **CONFIG_APP_LOCATION_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:**
  Watchdog timeout for the module's thread (default: 120 seconds).
  This covers both:

    * Waiting for an incoming message in zbus_sub_wait_msg()
    * Time spent processing the message, defined by the **CONFIG_APP_LOCATION_MSG_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS** Kconfig option.

    Must be larger than **CONFIG_APP_LOCATION_MSG_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS**.
    A small difference between the two can mean more frequent watchdog feeds, which increases power consumption.

- **CONFIG_APP_LOCATION_MSG_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS:**
  Maximum time allowed for processing a single message (default: 60 seconds).
  Must be smaller than the value set in the **CONFIG_APP_LOCATION_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_SECONDS** Kconfig option.

- **CONFIG_APP_LOCATION_WIFI_APS_MAX:**
  Maximum number of Wi-Fi access points recorded in a location request (default: 10).
  Scans in dense environments will see more than this and be truncated.

- **CONFIG_APP_LOCATION_NEIGHBOR_CELLS_MAX:**
  Maximum number of neighbor cells recorded in a location request (default: 10).

- **CONFIG_APP_LOCATION_SCAN_TRIGGER:**
  Handle **LOCATION_SCAN_SEARCH_TRIGGER**, a Wi-Fi and cellular scan with no GNSS (default: `n`).
  Requires both the Wi-Fi and cellular location methods. Selected by **CONFIG_APP_SURVEY**.

    When a scan-only request produces its cloud request, the module responds to the Location library
    with `LOCATION_EXT_RESULT_UNKNOWN` rather than cancelling the request. Cancelling cannot truly
    stop a Wi-Fi scan and can leave the next request returning `-EBUSY`, which matters because
    scan-only requests are issued repeatedly.

For more details on these configurations, refer to `Kconfig.location`.

## Location method priority

### Default method order

In the board configurations (`thingy91x_nrf9151_ns.conf`, `nrf9151dk_nrf9151_ns.conf`), set
the following default method priority order:

**Thingy91x** :

| Priority | Method | Kconfig option |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | GNSS | `CONFIG_LOCATION_REQUEST_DEFAULT_METHOD_FIRST_GNSS` |
| 2nd | Wi-Fi | `CONFIG_LOCATION_REQUEST_DEFAULT_METHOD_SECOND_WIFI` |
| 3rd | Cellular | `CONFIG_LOCATION_REQUEST_DEFAULT_METHOD_THIRD_CELLULAR` |

**nRF9151 DK**:

| Priority | Method | Kconfig option |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | GNSS | `CONFIG_LOCATION_REQUEST_DEFAULT_METHOD_FIRST_GNSS` |
| 2nd | Cellular | `CONFIG_LOCATION_REQUEST_DEFAULT_METHOD_SECOND_CELLULAR` |

See the
[nRF Cloud Location Services overview](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/nrf-cloud/page/LocationServices/LSOverview.html)
for a description of each method's accuracy, latency, and power
characteristics.

### Wi-Fi and cellular combining

When Wi-Fi and cellular methods are adjacent in the method list, the
Location library automatically combines them into a single
`LOCATION_METHOD_WIFI_CELLULAR` cloud request.

### Changing the method order

The method priority is controlled by the following Kconfig options in
the board configuration file or `prj.conf`:

- **`CONFIG_LOCATION_REQUEST_DEFAULT_METHOD_FIRST_*`**
- **`CONFIG_LOCATION_REQUEST_DEFAULT_METHOD_SECOND_*`**
- **`CONFIG_LOCATION_REQUEST_DEFAULT_METHOD_THIRD_*`**

## nRF Cloud location service usage

Wi-Fi and cellular location requests, including combined
`LOCATION_METHOD_WIFI_CELLULAR` requests are resolved by nRF Cloud and
count toward the monthly location request quota. GNSS resolves position
on-device and does not consume cloud requests.

The free Developer plan on nRF Cloud includes 1,500 location requests
per month. See the [nRF Cloud pricing page](https://nrfcloud.com/pricing/)
for current plan limits.
