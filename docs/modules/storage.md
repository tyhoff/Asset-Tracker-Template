# Storage module

The storage module forwards or stores data from enabled modules.

It is implemented as a small SMF state machine with a parent `RUNNING` state.
Data types are discovered automatically through iterable sections.
See `storage.c`, `storage.h`, and `Kconfig.storage` for details.

## Architecture

### State diagram

The Storage module implements a state machine with the following states and transitions:

![Storage module state diagram](../images/storage_module_state_diagram.svg "Storage module state diagram")

- **RUNNING** (parent): Initializes backend, handles admin commands (`STORAGE_CLEAR`, `STORAGE_FLUSH`, `STORAGE_STATS`, `STORAGE_SET_THRESHOLD`)
- **STATE_BUFFER_IDLE**: Storing incoming data, waiting for commands. Transitions to `STATE_BUFFER_PIPE_ACTIVE` on `STORAGE_BATCH_REQUEST`.
- **STATE_BUFFER_PIPE_ACTIVE**: Actively serving batch data through the batch interface. Transitions back to `STATE_BUFFER_IDLE` when batch session ends.

### Backend

Backends implement the API defined in the `app/src/modules/storage/storage_backend.h` file and provide `init`, `store`, `peek`, `retrieve`, `count`, and `clear` functionalities.

The storage module supports two backends:

#### RAM backend (Default)

- **Characteristics**: Fast in-memory storage
- **Data persistence**: Lost on power loss or device reset
- **Use case**: Applications that can tolerate data loss

#### LittleFS flash backend

- **Characteristics**: Persistent flash-based storage using the LittleFS filesystem
- **Data persistence**: Data survives power loss and device resets
- **Use case**: Applications requiring data durability and persistence across power cycles

### Data flow

Data producing modules publish sampled data to their respective zbus channel.
Data is stored and later emitted by flush or streamed over the batch pipe, using the batch interface described in the following section.

### Batch session protocol

Batch reads use a consume-on-confirm contract so that an item is only removed
from the backend after the consumer has confirmed it was processed (for example,
successfully sent to the cloud). A typical session looks like this:

1. Consumer publishes `STORAGE_BATCH_REQUEST` with a non-zero `session_id`.
1. The storage module responds with `STORAGE_BATCH_AVAILABLE` (with `data_len` set to the
   number of items available) and primes the pipe with the head item.
   If there is no data, it sends `STORAGE_BATCH_EMPTY`, and you must still close the session.
1. Consumer calls `storage_batch_read()` to read the head item. This call does **not** remove the item from the backend.
1. After the item has been processed, the consumer publishes
   `STORAGE_BATCH_CONSUME` with the matching `session_id` and the `data_type`
   of the item. The storage module removes the head item and primes the next one in the
   pipe.
1. Steps 3 and 4 repeat until `storage_batch_read()` returns `-EAGAIN`,
   or until the consumer decides to stop.
1. Consumer publishes `STORAGE_BATCH_CLOSE` to end the session.

If the consumer reads without consuming, `storage_batch_read()` repeatedly
returns the same head item. If a `STORAGE_BATCH_CONSUME` arrives with an
unknown or mismatched `data_type`, the storage module aborts the session with
`STORAGE_BATCH_ERROR` to avoid silent stalls.

### Memory management

This module allocates RAM from the following places, and understanding these helps you tune it down:

- Built-in batch pipe buffer: `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_BATCH_BUFFER_SIZE` bytes are reserved at boot.
- RAM backend ring buffers: For each enabled data type, a ring buffer is declared with capacity `sizeof(type) * CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE`.
- Message buffers: `struct storage_msg` carries a `buffer[STORAGE_MAX_DATA_SIZE]`, where `STORAGE_MAX_DATA_SIZE` is the max size of any enabled data type.
  Enabling large types increases this buffer and several temporary buffers.
- Subscriber queue: Size is controlled by system zbus configuration.
- Thread stack: `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_THREAD_STACK_SIZE`.

#### How to reduce RAM

- Minimize enabled data types

    - Disable modules that you do not forward or store (for example, `CONFIG_APP_LOCATION=n`), which
      reduces both slabs and RAM backend ring buffers and shrinks `STORAGE_MAX_DATA_SIZE`.

- Reduce records per type

    - Set `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE=1` when buffering is not needed.
      This shrinks both the per-type slabs and RAM ring buffers to a single record each.

- Shrink batch pipe buffer

    - Set the `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_BATCH_BUFFER_SIZE` Kconfig option to a lower value (for example,
      from 1024 down to 256 bytes), but ensure it can still hold at least one item of
      `sizeof(header) + max_item_size` if you use batch mode.

- Reduce thread and queues

    - Set the `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_THREAD_STACK_SIZE` Kconfig option to a lower value (for example, from 2048 down to 1024) if your application leaves headroom.
    - Reduce the relevant zbus queue sizes in the system configuration if traffic allows.

- Remove development features

    - Disable the `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_SHELL` and `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_SHELL_STATS` Kconfig option to trim RAM and code footprint.

- Prefer the LittleFS backend when buffering many records

    - Use the LittleFS backend when a large `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE` value is needed, because the RAM backend allocates all ring buffers at boot, while the LittleFS backend only uses RAM for the currently stored records.

- Ready-made Kconfig fragment

    - Use `overlay-storage-minimal.conf` to apply a minimal storage configuration with reduced RAM usage.

#### Minimal RAM example

If your application only needs immediate sending (`CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_INITIAL_THRESHOLD=1`), the following `prj.conf` excerpt minimizes RAM usage for the storage module.

```config
# Minimal storage configuration
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE=y
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_BACKEND_RAM=y

# Keep only a single slot per type (no buffering planned)
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE=1
# Send a message for every sample
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_INITIAL_THRESHOLD=1

# Drop development features
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_SHELL=n
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_SHELL_STATS=n
```

> [!NOTE]
> For the RAM backend, the actual RAM consumed by the ring buffers scales with which data types are enabled and the value of the `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE` Kconfig option.

### Flash management (LittleFS backend)

#### Partition sizing

You must configure the partition size for the LittleFS backend to accommodate the data types in use, their sizes, and the number of records per type. A minimum partition size is required to ensure proper operation.

How to calculate the needed size:

- Per-type block need:

```math
\text{blocks per type} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{data size} \times \text{records per type}}{\text{block size}} \right\rceil
```

- Total required blocks:

```math
\text{required blocks} = \sum \text{blocks per type} + 3
```

where the `+3` accounts for LittleFS metadata and the CoW block.

- Minimum partition size:

```math
\text{flash size} = \text{required blocks} \times \text{block size}
```

Choose a partition size that meets or exceeds `flash_size`. The LittleFS partition size is set by the `littlefs_storage` node in [`app/boards/att_flash_partitions.dtsi`](../../app/boards/att_flash_partitions.dtsi), which both board overlays include:

```devicetree
littlefs_storage: partition@4d2000 {
    label = "littlefs_storage";
    reg = <0x004d2000 0x00100000>;   /* 1 MiB */
};
```

The second `reg` cell (`0x00100000` above) is the partition size in bytes. To make the partition larger, raise that value and shrink the adjacent `external_flash_partition` by the same amount so the 32 MiB external flash layout stays consistent.

If the requirement is not met, either grow the partition in `att_flash_partitions.dtsi` as shown above, or reduce storage pressure (fewer records, smaller data types, or fewer enabled types).

> [!NOTE]
> The data types are stored in separate files, so the minimum number of flash blocks needed is ∑ data types + 3.

#### Behaviour when full

When a type already holds `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE` records and another arrives, the LittleFS backend does one of two things, chosen at build time:

| **Kconfig** | **Behaviour** | **Use when** |
| - | - | - |
| `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_FULL_OVERWRITE` (default) | Drop the oldest record and store the new one. `store()` returns 0. | The data is a live view of the device and only the recent past matters. This is the historical behaviour. |
| `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_FULL_STOP` | Reject the new record with `-ENOSPC` and keep everything already stored. | The data is a recording that is collected later. Overwriting would discard the start of a run, and nothing would notice until analysis. |

Under `FULL_STOP` the backend logs a warning per rejected record and `handle_data_message()` in `storage.c` logs an error; neither is fatal and the module keeps running. Reading records out (or `STORAGE_CLEAR`) makes room again — being full is not a latched state.

The choice applies to every registered type. There is no per-type override.

A failed `store()` also **skips the buffer-threshold check**. Nothing was added, so the count is unchanged and the check could only re-announce a threshold that was already announced — which under `FULL_STOP` would mean one `STORAGE_THRESHOLD_REACHED` per capture, forever, once the partition filled. The state machine reads that message as "send now".

#### Producer backpressure and the zbus net_buf pool

The storage module is a `ZBUS_MSG_SUBSCRIBER`, so zbus copies every message bound for it into a `net_buf` and the buffer is held until the storage thread retires it. Stores are neither quick nor bounded — LittleFS compacts the record directory's metadata pair on append, and that cost grows with the entry count. Single writes of **14 s** and **43.9 s** were measured on target at only a few hundred entries. A producer that outruns the storage thread therefore drains the pool.

zbus does not report that as an error. `_zbus_vded_exec()` asserts on the failed allocation, and the device reboots:

```
ASSERTION FAIL @ zephyr/subsys/zbus/zbus.c:252
net_buf zbus_msg_subscribers_pool is unavailable or heap is full
<err> os: ***** USAGE FAULT ***** Attempt to execute undefined instruction
```

So the timeout a publisher passes to `zbus_chan_pub()` is not "give up after this long", it is "panic after this long". `survey_store_publish()` passes `K_FOREVER` for that reason — not because it provides backpressure, but because no finite value can do better and a short one turns an ordinary slow store into a panic.

It is worth being precise about which half of the allocation can wait, because only one can. The `net_buf` *descriptor* comes from a pool of `CONFIG_ZBUS_MSG_SUBSCRIBER_NET_BUF_POOL_SIZE` entries (this application sets **64** in `prj.conf`) and that wait honours the timeout. The buffer's *data* comes from `heap_data_alloc()` under the default `CONFIG_ZBUS_MSG_SUBSCRIBER_BUF_ALLOC_DYNAMIC`, which accepts a `k_timeout_t` and then ignores it in favour of a non-blocking `k_malloc()` on the 12,288-byte system heap. Nothing can wait on that — and since an 816-byte message plus overhead exhausts 12,288 bytes at roughly a dozen in flight, the heap runs out long before the 64 descriptors do. **The blocking half is therefore unreachable in this configuration; every real failure is the non-blocking half asserting.** That is also why raising `CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE` only moves the cliff rather than removing it.

Three configurations were tried on target and all three are worse than the problem; `app/overlay-survey.conf` records them in full. In summary: raising `CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE` only moves the cliff (32768 still panicked); `CONFIG_ZBUS_MSG_SUBSCRIBER_BUF_ALLOC_STATIC` makes the allocation blocking but the pool is global, so a waiting survey producer starves `power`, `environmental` and `location`, which publish with `PUB_TIMEOUT` and assert in turn; and `CONFIG_ZBUS_MSG_SUBSCRIBER_NET_BUF_POOL_ISOLATION`, which would fix it properly, is broken in NCS 3.4.0 / Zephyr 4.4 — `zbus.h:307` guards the per-channel pool initialiser with `IF_ENABLED(ZBUS_MSG_SUBSCRIBER_NET_BUF_POOL_ISOLATION, ...)`, missing the `CONFIG_` prefix every other reference in that file has, so the pool stays `NULL` and the first publish dereferences it (measured: boot loop at 0.9 s).

**Normal capture is not exposed to any of this.** One record is in flight at a time, 10–30 s apart, so the heap holds a single 816-byte message and the allocation never comes close to failing however slow flash is. Reaching the hazard takes a burst, and the only thing in the build that bursts is the bench command `survey fill` — see `CONFIG_APP_SURVEY_SHELL_FILL`, which is `n` by default and documents how to run long fills in batches.

#### Types with no cloud handler

`send_storage_data_to_cloud()` in `cloud.c` returns `-ENOTSUP` for a storage type it has no branch for. The batch drain treats that as **end of session, do not consume**: the record stays on flash.

This matters because consuming is destructive — `STORAGE_BATCH_CONSUME` makes the storage thread `retrieve()` the record, which advances the read offset past it permanently. A type whose data leaves the device by some other route (the survey build exports over USB rather than uploading) would otherwise lose everything it had stored the first time the device connected to the cloud. `-EINVAL`, which means a handler exists and rejected the item as malformed, still consumes; otherwise one bad record would wedge the queue.

Ending the session ends it for **every** type, not just the unhandled one. The batch is a FIFO, so there is no way to skip the head item without consuming it, and `populate_pipe()` offers types in linker order. A build that registers both a handled type and an unhandled one will therefore stop uploading the handled one as soon as the unhandled one has records to offer. The survey build accepts that — it registers `BATTERY`, `ENVIRONMENTAL` and `SURVEY`, and uploading the first two is not what the device is for, whereas deleting a survey capture is unrecoverable. A build that genuinely needs both should skip handler-less types in `populate_pipe()` instead of offering them and aborting in `cloud.c`.

#### Target-specific defaults

Block size comes from the mounted filesystem (`fs_statvfs()`), which on ATT targets uses external SPI-NOR with `CONFIG_SPI_NOR_FLASH_LAYOUT_PAGE_SIZE=4096` (0x1000). The table below illustrates minimal sizing for a **small** configuration (three data types, eight records per type); the shipped default is **1 MiB** with up to **256** records per type, which needs far more blocks—the LittleFS backend checks sizing at init (see the `LittleFS partition size verified` log line) or use the formula above.

| **Target** | **Block size** | **Example blocks needed** | **Example minimal partition** |
| - | - | - | - |
| nrf9151 DK / Thingy:91 X (external SPI-NOR) | 0x1000 (4096 B) | 8 + 3 metadata | 0x2c000 (~176 KiB) |
| Internal flash (not recommended) | 0x1000 | 8 + 3 metadata | 0x2c000 |

The default **1 MiB** (`0x00100000`) partition on both boards leaves ample margin for all enabled data types at `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE=256`.

#### LittleFS built-in wear leveling

LittleFS provides inherent wear leveling at the filesystem level:

- LittleFS automatically distributes writes across available flash blocks, avoiding repeated writes to the same physical location.
- Filesystem metadata is spread across the partition, preventing hotspots on metadata blocks.
- Updates are written to new blocks rather than overwriting existing data, naturally distributing erase cycles.
- As blocks become dirty, LittleFS reclaims and redistributes them, ensuring uniform wear across the entire partition.
- The filesystem tracks block usage patterns and preferentially allocates less-worn blocks for new writes.

#### Application-level ring buffer wear leveling

The storage module adds an additional wear leveling layer through its ring buffer architecture.

##### Block-level distribution

- Entries are distributed across files matched to flash blocks.
- Each data type has its own file, preventing cross-type interference.
- Writes cycle through all available record slots before overwriting.
- Rewrites only modify the affected flash blocks, minimizing unnecessary writes.

#### Combined wear protection

The combination of LittleFS wear leveling and the ring buffer architecture provides:

- **Temporal distribution**: Ring buffer spreads writes over time across record slots.
- **Spatial distribution**: LittleFS spreads those writes across physical flash blocks.
- **Type isolation**: Each data type has its own write pattern, preventing interference.
- **Automatic wear balancing**: No configuration needed—works transparently.

#### Minimizing flash wear

To further optimize flash lifespan:

- **Increase partition size**: Larger partitions provide more blocks for write distribution.
- **Increase record count**: Higher `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE` reduces rewrite frequency.
- **Use ram backend when possible**: If data persistence is not critical, use the RAM backend to avoid flash writes entirely.

#### Configuration examples

The following sections showcase various configuration examples.

##### Basic LittleFS configuration

To enable persistent flash storage:

```config
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE=y
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_BACKEND_LITTLEFS=y

# Adjust for your needs
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE=16
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_THREAD_STACK_SIZE=4000
```

The partition size is configured in devicetree (see *Minimum partition size* above). The default `littlefs_storage` partition is 1 MiB on both the Thingy:91 X and the nRF9151 DK.

##### Optimized for data persistence with minimal flash wear

```config
# Storage enabled with persistent backend
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE=y
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_BACKEND_LITTLEFS=y

# Higher record count reduces rewrite frequency
CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE=50
```

To improve wear leveling further, grow the `littlefs_storage` partition in `att_flash_partitions.dtsi` so writes are spread across more flash blocks. See *Minimum partition size* above for the exact devicetree snippet to edit.

## Messages

The storage module communicates through two zbus channels: `storage_chan` and `storage_data_chan`.
All message types are defined in the `storage.h` file.

### Input messages (Commands)

**Data operations (handled by parent `RUNNING` state):**

- **STORAGE_SET_THRESHOLD**: Set the threshold for triggering `STORAGE_THRESHOLD_REACHED`.
  If threshold is `1`, every sample triggers a message. Higher values enable buffering until the threshold is reached.

- **STORAGE_FLUSH**: Flushes stored data one item at a time as individual `STORAGE_DATA` messages.
  Data is sent in FIFO order per type. Available in both operational modes.

- **STORAGE_BATCH_REQUEST**: Requests access to stored data through batch interface.
  Responds with `STORAGE_BATCH_AVAILABLE`, `STORAGE_BATCH_EMPTY`, `STORAGE_BATCH_BUSY`, or `STORAGE_BATCH_ERROR`.
  Available in both operational modes.

- **STORAGE_BATCH_CONSUME**: Confirms that the head item of an active batch session has been
  processed (for example, successfully sent to the cloud). The `session_id` must match the
  active session and `data_type` must identify the type of the item just read with
  `storage_batch_read()`. Storage removes the item from the backend and makes the next item
  available in the pipe. An unknown or mismatched `data_type` aborts the session.

- **STORAGE_BATCH_CLOSE**: Ends a batch session. Must be sent for every session, including
  sessions that received `STORAGE_BATCH_EMPTY` or `STORAGE_BATCH_ERROR`.

- **STORAGE_CLEAR**: Clears all stored data from the backend.
  Available in both operational modes.

**Diagnostics (handled by parent RUNNING state):**

- **STORAGE_STATS** : Requests storage statistics (requires `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_SHELL_STATS`).
  Statistics are logged to the console.
  Available in both operational modes.

### Output messages (Responses)

**Data events:**

- **STORAGE_THRESHOLD_REACHED**: Emitted when the number of stored samples for a type reaches the configured threshold.
  Contains the data type and count that triggered the event.

**Data messages:**

- **STORAGE_DATA**: Contains stored data being flushed or forwarded.
  Includes data type and the actual data payload.

**Batch status:**

- **STORAGE_BATCH_AVAILABLE**: Batch is ready for reading.
  Message includes total item count available and session ID.

- **STORAGE_BATCH_EMPTY**: No stored data available.
  Batch is empty.

- **STORAGE_BATCH_BUSY**: Another module is currently using the batch session.

- **STORAGE_BATCH_ERROR**: Error occurred during batch operation.

### Message structure

The message structure used by the storage module is defined in `storage.h`:

```c
struct storage_msg {
    enum storage_msg_type type;           /* Message type */
    enum storage_data_type data_type;     /* Data type for STORAGE_DATA / STORAGE_BATCH_CONSUME */
    union {
        uint8_t buffer[STORAGE_MAX_DATA_SIZE];
        uint32_t session_id;              /* Batch session id */
    };
    uint32_t data_len;                    /* Length or count */
};
```

## Configurations

The storage module is configurable through Kconfig options in `Kconfig.storage`.
The following includes the key configuration categories:

### Storage backend

- **CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_BACKEND_RAM** (default): Uses RAM for storage.
  Data is lost on a power cycle but provides fast access.

- **CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_BACKEND_LITTLEFS** : Uses the LittleFS filesystem for flash storage.
  Data is persistent across power cycles but provides slower access.

### Memory configuration

- **CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_TYPES** (default: `3`): Maximum number of different data types that can be registered.
  Affects RAM usage.

- **CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE** (default: `8` for the RAM backend, `256` for the LittleFS backend): Maximum records stored per data type.
  Total RAM usage = `MAX_TYPES` × `MAX_RECORDS_PER_TYPE` × `RECORD_SIZE`.

- **CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_BATCH_BUFFER_SIZE** (default: `512`): Size of the internal buffer for batch data access.

### Flash configuration (LittleFS backend)

The `littlefs_storage` partition (size and host flash chip) is defined in devicetree. [`app/boards/att_flash_partitions.dtsi`](../../app/boards/att_flash_partitions.dtsi) declares the partition on external SPI-NOR and the `lfs1` `zephyr,fstab,littlefs` entry (mount point `/att_storage`, automount). Board overlays [`thingy91x_nrf9151_ns.overlay`](../../app/boards/thingy91x_nrf9151_ns.overlay) and [`nrf9151dk_nrf9151_ns.overlay`](../../app/boards/nrf9151dk_nrf9151_ns.overlay) include that file.

To resize the partition, edit the second `reg` cell of `littlefs_storage` in `att_flash_partitions.dtsi` (and shrink `external_flash_partition` by the same amount). To move it to internal flash, declare a `littlefs_storage` node under `&flash0`'s `partitions` instead, note that the nRF9151's 1 MiB internal flash is already heavily utilized by `slot0_partition`, so external flash is strongly recommended for any non-trivial storage size.

### Threshold configuration

- **CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_INITIAL_THRESHOLD** (default: `1`): Initial threshold for triggering `STORAGE_THRESHOLD_REACHED` events.
  A value of 1 means every sample triggers an event, while higher values enable buffering until the threshold is reached.
  You can change the threshold at runtime through `STORAGE_SET_THRESHOLD` messages.

### Thread configuration

- **CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_THREAD_STACK_SIZE** (default: `2048` for the RAM backend, `4000` for the LittleFS backend): Stack size for the storage module's main thread.

- **CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_SECONDS** (default: `60`): Watchdog timeout for detecting stuck operations.

- **CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_MSG_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS** (default: `5`): Maximum time for processing a single message.

### Development features

- **CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_SHELL** (default: `y`): Enable shell commands for storage interaction.

- **CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_SHELL_STATS**: Enable statistics commands (increases code size).

### Message handling

- **RUNNING state**: Handles `STORAGE_CLEAR`, `STORAGE_FLUSH`, `STORAGE_STATS`, and `STORAGE_SET_THRESHOLD` messages.
- **BUFFER_IDLE**: Handles `STORAGE_BATCH_REQUEST` to transition to `BUFFER_PIPE_ACTIVE`.
- **BUFFER_PIPE_ACTIVE**: Populates pipe with `[header + data]` items, handles session management.

## API documentation

### Channels

#### storage channel

The storage channel is the primary zbus channel for controlling the storage module and receiving control or status responses.

**Input message types:**

- `STORAGE_SET_THRESHOLD` - Set threshold for `STORAGE_THRESHOLD_REACHED` events
- `STORAGE_FLUSH` - Flush stored data as individual messages
- `STORAGE_BATCH_REQUEST` - Request batch access to stored data
- `STORAGE_CLEAR` - Clear all stored data
- `STORAGE_STATS` - Display storage statistics

**Output message types:**

- `STORAGE_THRESHOLD_REACHED` - Threshold reached for a data type
- `STORAGE_BATCH_AVAILABLE` - Batch ready with data
- `STORAGE_BATCH_EMPTY` - No data available
- `STORAGE_BATCH_BUSY` - Another session active
- `STORAGE_BATCH_ERROR` - Error accessing data

#### storage data channel

This is a dedicated channel for `STORAGE_DATA` payload messages to avoid self-flooding and race conditions.
The subscribers interested in data should observe this channel.

**Output message types:**

- `STORAGE_DATA` - Contains stored or forwarded data.

### Data type registration

Data types are automatically registered using the `DATA_SOURCE_LIST` macro in `storage_data_types.h`. The system currently supports:

- **Battery** (`CONFIG_APP_POWER`): Stores `double` from `POWER_BATTERY_PERCENTAGE_SAMPLE_RESPONSE`
- **Location** (`CONFIG_APP_LOCATION`): Stores `struct location_msg` from `LOCATION_GNSS_DATA`/`LOCATION_CLOUD_REQUEST`
- **Environmental** (`CONFIG_APP_ENVIRONMENTAL`): Stores `struct environmental_msg` from `ENVIRONMENTAL_SENSOR_SAMPLE_RESPONSE`

Each data type registration includes:

- Source channel to subscribe to
- Message type filtering function
- Data extraction function
- Storage data type identifier

### Backend interface

Storage backends implement the interface defined in the `app/src/modules/storage/storage_backend.h` file:

```c
struct storage_backend {
    int (*init)(void);
    int (*store)(const struct storage_data *type, void *data, size_t size);
    int (*peek)(const struct storage_data *type, void *data, size_t size);
    int (*retrieve)(const struct storage_data *type, void *data, size_t size);
    int (*count)(const struct storage_data *type);
    int (*clear)(void);
};
```

### Batch read helper

The storage module provides a convenience function for reading batch data:

```c
int storage_batch_read(struct storage_data_item *out_item, k_timeout_t timeout);
```

It reads stored data through the batch interface, handling header parsing and data extraction automatically. All other operations (requesting batch access, session management, etc.) go through zbus messages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This function should only be called after receiving a `STORAGE_BATCH_AVAILABLE` message in response to a `STORAGE_BATCH_REQUEST`.
> When done consuming all items, send `STORAGE_BATCH_CLOSE` with the same `session_id`.

## Usage

### Data retrieval

**Flush:** `STORAGE_FLUSH` emits individual `STORAGE_DATA` messages. Use for small datasets.

**Batch:** For bulk access, use `STORAGE_BATCH_REQUEST` with unique `session_id`:

```c
struct storage_msg msg = { .type = STORAGE_BATCH_REQUEST, .session_id = 0x12345678 };

err = zbus_chan_pub(&storage_chan, &msg, K_SECONDS(1));

// Wait for STORAGE_BATCH_AVAILABLE, then:
struct storage_data_item item;
while (storage_batch_read(&item, K_SECONDS(1)) == 0) {
    switch (item.type) {
    case STORAGE_TYPE_BATTERY:
        double battery = item.data.BATTERY;
        break;
    // ... handle other types
    }
}

// Close session
struct storage_msg close = { .type = STORAGE_BATCH_CLOSE, .session_id = 0x12345678 };
zbus_chan_pub(&storage_chan, &close, K_SECONDS(1));
```

Responses: `STORAGE_BATCH_AVAILABLE` (success), `STORAGE_BATCH_EMPTY`, `STORAGE_BATCH_BUSY`, `STORAGE_BATCH_ERROR`.

### Processing `STORAGE_DATA`

Subscribe to `storage_data_chan` to receive forwarded/flushed data:

```c
switch (msg->data_type) {
case STORAGE_TYPE_BATTERY:
    double *battery = (double *)msg->buffer;

    break;
case STORAGE_TYPE_LOCATION:
    struct location_msg *loc = (struct location_msg *)msg->buffer;

    break;
/* ... other types */
}
```

### Admin commands

```c
/* Clear all stored data */
struct storage_msg msg = { .type = STORAGE_CLEAR };

err = zbus_chan_pub(&storage_chan, &msg, K_SECONDS(1));

/* Show statistics (requires CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_SHELL_STATS) */
struct storage_msg msg = { .type = STORAGE_STATS };

err = zbus_chan_pub(&storage_chan, &msg, K_SECONDS(1));
```

### Shell commands

When `CONFIG_APP_STORAGE_SHELL` is enabled:

```bash
att_storage flush              # Flush stored data
att_storage clear              # Clear all data
att_storage stats              # Show statistics (if enabled)
```

## Adding backends

1. Implement `struct storage_backend` (see `storage_backend.h`).
1. Provide `storage_backend_get()` function.
1. Add Kconfig option in `Kconfig.storage`.

See `backends/ram_ring_buffer_backend.c` for reference.
